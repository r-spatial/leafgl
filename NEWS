leafgl 0.2.1.9005 (2023-09-08)

features and improvements

bug fixes

  * src version now works also in shiny. #71
  * added `popupOptions` and `labelOptions`. #83
  * added `stroke` (default=TRUE) in `addGlPolygons` and `addGlPolygonsSrc` for drawing borders. #3
  * Labels work similar to `leaflet`. `leafgl` accepts a single string, a vector of strings or a formula. #78
  * The `...` arguments are now passed to all methods in the underlying library. This allows us to set
    additional arguments like `fragmentShaderSource`, sensitivity` or `sensitivityHover`.

documentation etc

 * Added some @details for Shiny click and mouseover events and their corresponding input. #77
 * Using `@inheritParams leaflet::addPolylines` instead of writing the documentation on our own.
