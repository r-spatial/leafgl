# leafgl 0.2.1.9005 (2023-09-08)

#### ✨ features and improvements

-   Switched from `jsonify` and `geojsonsf` to `yyjsonr`
-   New method `clearGlGroup` removes a group from leaflet and the Leaflet.Glify instances.
-   The JavaScript methods of the `removeGl**` functions was rewritten to correctly remove an element identified by `layerId`
-   `clearGlLayers` now correctly removes all Leaflet.Glify instances
-   When showing/hiding Leaflet.Glify layers, they are set to active = TRUE/FALSE to make mouseevents work again. [#48](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/48) [#50](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/50)

#### 🐛 bug fixes

-   Increase precision of points, lines and shapes by translating them closer to the Pixel Origin. Thanks @RayLarone [#93](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/93)
-   src version now works also in shiny. [#71](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/71)
-   added `popupOptions` and `labelOptions`. [#83](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/83)
-   added `stroke` (default=TRUE) in `addGlPolygons` and `addGlPolygonsSrc` for drawing borders. [#3](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/3) [#68](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/68)
-   Labels work similar to `leaflet`. `leafgl` accepts a single string, a vector of strings or a formula. [#78](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/78)
-   The `...` arguments are now passed to all methods in the underlying library. This allows us to set additional arguments like `fragmentShaderSource`, `sensitivity` or `sensitivityHover`. [#81](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/81)

#### 💬 documentation etc

-   Added some @details for Shiny click and mouseover events and their corresponding input. [#77](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/77)
-   Use `@inheritParams leaflet::**` for identical function arguments

#### 🍬 miscellaneous

-   update upstream javascript dependency to 3.3.0. [#49](https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl/issues/49)

    ⚠️If you previously used the workaround `L.glify.Shapes.instances.splice(0, 1)`, please remove it with this new version.
